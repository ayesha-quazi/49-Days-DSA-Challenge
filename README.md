# 49-Days DSA Challenge

Welcome to my 49-Day DSA journey! Over the next 49 days, Iâ€™ll be sharing my progress as I tackle challenging DSA problems in C++. These problems are part of the *Last Minute Revision* series provided by *Fraz Sir*. My goal is to solidify my understanding and apply key concepts daily.

**Challenge Start Date:** 16th November 2024 <br>
**Language:** C++

### Day 1
1. **3Sum** - Used a sorted array with a two-pointer approach to efficiently find unique triplets summing to zero, while skipping duplicates and handling edge cases.

<hr> 

### Day 2
2. **Sort Colors** - Applied a counting sort approach to efficiently sort an array with elements 0, 1, and 2. Key takeaway: prioritize simplicity for fixed-range problems.

3. **Next Permutation** - Unlocked the logic to find the next lexicographical permutation. The trick? Identify the pivot, swap strategically, and reverse the suffix.

### Day 3

4. **Product of Array Except Self**- Efficiently computed products without division using left and right prefix products.

5. **Increment Submatrices by One** - Optimized range updates in a 2D grid with prefix sums to handle overlapping increments.

### Day 4

6. **First Missing Positive** - Solved in linear time using in-place bucket sorting to handle the smallest missing positive integer.

7. **Count of Smaller Numbers After Self** - Leveraged binary indexed trees (BIT) or merge sort for an efficient count of smaller elements.

### Day 5

8. Rotate Image: Here I've used matrix transposition and reversal to rotate a 2D array in place efficiently.

9. Spiral Matrix: And here used traverse a matrix layer by layer using controlled boundary variables.

### Day 6

10. Majority Element: Implemented the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to efficiently find the majority element in linear time and constant space.

11. Subarray Sum Equals K: Used a prefix sum with a hashmap to count subarrays that sum up to a target value in O(n) time.

### Day 7

12. Reverse Linked List: Used iteration to reverse a linked list in-place, showcasing the importance of pointer manipulation in linked data structures.

13. Sort List: Applied merge sort on a linked list for efficient sorting with O(n log n) time complexity while managing space constraints.
