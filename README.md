# 49-Days DSA Challenge

Welcome to my 49-Day DSA journey! Over the next 49 days, Iâ€™ll be sharing my progress as I tackle challenging DSA problems in C++. These problems are part of the *Last Minute Revision* series provided by *Fraz Sir*. My goal is to solidify my understanding and apply key concepts daily.

**Challenge Start Date:** 14th November 2024 <br>
**Language:** C++

### Day 1
**Problems Solved:**  
1. **3Sum** - Implemented an algorithm to find all unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero.
2. **Sort Colors** - Used a Dutch National Flag algorithm to sort an array of colors represented as integers (0, 1, 2) in a single pass.
