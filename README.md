# 49-Days DSA Challenge

Welcome to my 49-Day DSA journey! Over the next 49 days, Iâ€™ll be sharing my progress as I tackle challenging DSA problems in C++. These problems are part of the *Last Minute Revision* series provided by *Fraz Sir*. My goal is to solidify my understanding and apply key concepts daily.

### Day 1
**Problem Solved:**  
1. **3Sum** - Used a sorted array with a two-pointer approach to efficiently find unique triplets summing to zero, while skipping duplicates and handling edge cases.

### Day 2
**Problems Solved:**  

2. **Sort Colors** - Applied a counting sort approach to efficiently sort an array with elements 0, 1, and 2. Key takeaway: prioritize simplicity for fixed-range problems.

3. **Next Permutation** - Unlocked the logic to find the next lexicographical permutation. The trick? Identify the pivot, swap strategically, and reverse the suffix.
